				<h1>Hey Loodwig! I've been studing really hard. I've finally got it right. Guess what spell I finally memorized.</h1>
				<p><b>School</b> abjuration [force]; <b>Level</b> sorcerer/wizard 3</p>
				<p><b>Casting Time</b> 1 standard action</p>
				<p><b>Components</b> V, S</p>
				<p><b>Range</b> touch</p>
				<p><b>Target</b> one touched object weighing no more than 10 lbs.</p>
				<p><b>Duration</b> permanent until discharged (D)</p>
				<p><b>Saving Throw</b> see text; <b>Spell Resistance</b> yes</p>
				<p>You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The <i>explosive runes </i>detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the <i>explosive runes </i>(close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the <i>explosive runes </i>is entitled to a <a href="http://paizo.com/prd/combat.html#_reflex" >Reflex</a> save for half damage. The object on which the <i>explosive runes </i>were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).</p>
				<p>You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the <i>explosive runes. </i>Likewise, you can remove the <i>explosive runes </i>whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful <i><a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic" >dispel magic</a> </i>or <i>erase </i>spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the <i>explosive runes </i>and failing to do so triggers the explosion.</p>
				<p>Magic traps such as <i>explosive runes </i>are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart <i>explosive runes</i>. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for <i>explosive runes</i>.</p>
